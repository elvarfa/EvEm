I definitely feel that our readme should include certain goals for the week, so that we can work with that in mind. 

I spent some of my free time finding two alright resources that might be interesting for us and also working on finding a naming method that doesn't confuse the hell out of me. I still feel like it could be made much more readable by not making so many general methods and that we now risk confusing methods since they are a bit too general in what we want them to do.

The following seems to be a really nice manual to keep close by when searching for more info on the cpu and other interesting things.

Well that's just what I think though. We really should have clear guidelines for what we want to accomplish in each week.
